# `default_cwd`

Sets the default current working directory used by the initial window. If
`wezterm start --cwd /some/path` is used to specify the current working
directory, that will take precedence.

Commands launched using [`SpawnCommand`](../SpawnCommand.md) will use the
`cwd` specified in the `SpawnCommand`, if any.

Panes/Tabs/Windows created after the first will generally try to resolve the
current working directory of the current Pane, preferring
[a value set by OSC 7](../../../shell-integration.markdown) and falling back to
attempting to lookup the `cwd` of the current process group leader attached to a
local Pane. If no `cwd` can be resolved, then the `default_cwd` will be used.
If `default_cwd` is not specified, then the home directory of the user will be
used.

On macOS and Linux, `wezterm` can attempt to resolve the process group leader
and then attempt to resolve its current working directory. This is not
guaranteed to succeed, and there are a number of potential edge cases (which is
another reason for configuring your shell to use OSC 7 sequences).
